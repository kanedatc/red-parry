1. Create a record of an youtube video and register matches for it.
1. Filter the registered records and matches by:
    * Player 1 and Player 2 names.
    * Payler 1 and Player 2 characters.
    * Youtube video title.
    * Youtube video channel.
2. You can save, edit, and remove records and their matches.
